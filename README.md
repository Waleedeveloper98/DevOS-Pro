# DevOS Pro 🖥️✨

DevOS Pro is an **OS-inspired web application** built with **React.js** that simulates a desktop-like user experience in the browser.
This project is **not a real operating system** — it is a **frontend UI simulation** created to explore how desktop interactions (windows, dock, apps, context menus) can be designed on the web.

The goal of DevOS Pro is to move beyond traditional page-based navigation and experiment with **app-based UI architecture**, **state-driven interactions**, and **polished micro-interactions**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧭 Desktop-Style Interface

- macOS-inspired **header/navigation bar**
- Centered **dock** with smooth hover magnification
- Tooltips on hover showing the app name
- Clean, minimal desktop layout

### 🧩 Dock Applications

DevOS Pro includes multiple apps accessible from the dock:

- **GitHub** – Opens GitHub inside a window or external link
- **Notes** – Terminal-style notes interface
- **Resume** – Resume preview inside a window
- **Calendar** – Opens Google Calendar
- **Spotify** – Embedded Spotify player (iframe)
- **Email** – Quick access to email
- **LinkedIn** – Opens LinkedIn profile
- **Wallpapers** – Change desktop background
- **Terminal** – Custom command-based terminal

Each app opens inside its **own window**, simulating a real desktop environment.

## 🪟 Window System

- Windows open dynamically when apps are clicked
- App windows behave like desktop applications
- Context-aware interactions for better UX

---

## 🖱️ Context Menu (Right-Click)

- Custom **right-click context menu** on windows
- Provides quick shortcuts to open apps
- Mimics desktop OS behavior instead of browser defaults

---

## 🎨 Wallpapers & Persistence

- Dedicated **Wallpaper app** to change desktop background
- Selected wallpaper is saved in **localStorage**
- Wallpaper persists even after page reload

---

## 🧑‍💻 Terminal

- Custom terminal with predefined commands
- Commands display structured information about:
  - About
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Contact details

- Command-driven interaction instead of buttons

---

## 🐈 Fun UI Touch

- Integrated **Lottie animation**
- A cute black cat appears and hides, adding personality
- Small detail to make the interface feel friendly and alive

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built to:

- Practice **advanced UI patterns** in React
- Understand **desktop-style interaction design**
- Improve skills in **state management** and **component architecture**
- Go beyond basic CRUD and page-based portfolios

DevOS Pro represents an experiment in **how rich, product-like experiences can be built on the web using React**.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- This is **not a real operating system**
- No kernel, file system, or real process management
- Runs entirely inside the browser

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Window minimize / maximize behavior
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd + Space, Cmd + W)
- Improved window focus & layering
- More terminal commands
- App search / spotlight feature
